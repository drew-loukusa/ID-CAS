#TODO

* Implement derivatives:
	u^v 
	e^u 		- 	(Need to add support to lexer and tree before adding to diff)

* Implement integrals

* Create detailed explanations of code/algorithms, of each step
* Comment more code
* Pick a consistant nameing scheme (no caps with underscores or camelcase or whatever. PICK ONE)
* Refactor code
* Better end-user error handling: If they type in an unsupported expression, let them know in a nice way.



DONE:
- Sin, Cos, Tan
- NEGATIVES as input
- Negative numbers? Like with '-cos(x)' Thoughts? Deal with this
