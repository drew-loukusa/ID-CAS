#TODO

1. Implement derivatives:
	tan(u)  	
	1/tan(u) ? 
	u^v 
	e^u 		- 	(Need to add support to lexer and tree before adding to diff)

2. Negative numbers? Like with '-cos(x)' Thoughts? Deal with this
3. Create detailed explanations of code/algorithms, of each step
4. Comment more code
5. Pick a consistant nameing scheme (no caps with underscores or camelcase or whatever. PICK ONE)
6. Implement integrals
7. Refactor code
8. Better end-user error handling: If they type in an unsupported expression, let them know in a nice way.

9. NEGATIVES as input
