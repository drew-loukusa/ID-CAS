#TODO

1. Implement derivatives:
	cos(u) 
	tan(u)  
	1/cos(u)	?
	1/sin(u)	?
	1/tan(u) ? 
	u^v 
	e^u 		- 	(Need to add support to lexer and tree before adding to diff)

2. Negative numbers? Like with '-cos(x)' Thoughts? Deal with this
3. Create detailed explanations of code/algorithms, of each step
4. Comment more code
5. Pick a consistant nameing scheme (no caps with underscores or camelcase or whatever. PICK ONE)
6. Implement integrals
7. Refactor code
